    <h1>Hi Again Sissy!</h1> 
    <p>
     So this isn't a part of my birthday message for you, I'm done with that hahaha. Maybe you're thinkin' what's this for. I actually saw one of your many reposts on tiktok, it says that you want a detailed paragraph of how we see you, so this is just my entry.  I don't know if I can pull this off but, here it is so just sit back,relax,and enjoy.(I guess?)

     You were a piece of art, I’d never get tired of looking at you.
     That’s how I feel every time I see you. It’s not just the way you look, but the way you carries yourself, the way you move through the world. Every little thing about you catches my attention in a way that makes me want to look closer, to study every detail. Like a painting that pulls you in and makes you feel something you can’t quite explain, you have that same effect on me.
     <br>
     The moment our ways met, I was already fascinated with how well you move. Since then, I have been attracted to every part of you including the laughter you have, your smile, and the kindness you possess. Particularly your features-those rosy lips, your brown eyes that glistened like a star when a sun directly passed through it, and your skin. The confidence you have when you walk, the passion you have when you talk, and the compassion you have when you listen are all things I have learned from you. Being with you is my most preferred destination, and I enjoy every moment spent with you.

     Your charm has always been as beautiful as the goddess of beauty; Aphrodite. Each time I would try to take a picture of you with a camera, I would have to stare at your beauty for a few seconds before actually clicking the picture of you. Even if you're doing nothing else, my love, these eyes are fixed on you. I respect you as much as the gods respect the beauty of Aphrodite. For me, you need nothing else, you and your beauty have always been sufficient to make me whole.

     I look at you like you put the stars in the sky. Well you are my stars. Looking at you gives me butterflies, hearing your voice gives me butterflies, locking eyes with you gives me butterflies
     <br>
     It’s the way your smile lights up a room, the way your eyes seem to hold a thousand stories, the way your laugh fills the air with warmth. I could spend hours just watching you, not even needing to say anything, just taking in the beauty of her presence. There’s something about the way you exists that makes the world feel more alive, like everything else fades away when you're around. You're not perfect, but it’s your imperfections that make you even more captivating.
